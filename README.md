ðŸ‘‹ Hello world, my name is John Pham.

Growing up, I realized that I have always had a passion for learning, and in the tech industry, that's all I do. As a software engineer, I wish to contribute to a forever developing field, which is what lead me to start my career and education at the Georgia Institute of Technology as a Computer Science major with a concentration of media and intelligence.
